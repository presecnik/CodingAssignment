# CodingAssignment

## Foreword

First of all - this assignment shouldnâ€™t be too hard. Seriously. It contains no tricks and you don't need to be a genius to do it. Please use Git while developing the code. **Keep it as simple as possible. Do not over-engineer.** Be ready to explain / demonstrate your solution in a peer code review.


## Background
Your task is to build a web application that allows users to manage projects and tasks related to those projects. Each project should have a name, description, sale price, start date, and end date. Each task should have a name, description, due date, and assigned user.


## Requirements
Your application should meet the following requirements:
1. The application should be a web application built using ASP.NET and C#.
1. The application should use Entity Framework to store and retrieve projects and tasks from a database.
1. The application should use Razor templates to render views.
1. The application should have a home page that displays a list of all projects.
1. The application should allow adding and editing a project.
1. The application should have a project portal page for viewing project details and all tasks related to a project.
1. The project page should have an option that allows the user to add, edit or delete a task.

Test your application to make sure it works as expected. Upload your code to a GitHub repository and send us the link.

## Evaluation
We will evaluate your code based on the following criteria:

**Correctness**: Does your code work as expected?

**Maintainability**: Is your code easy to modify and extend?

**Best practices**: Does your code follow best practices for ASP.NET and C# development?


> Good luck!
